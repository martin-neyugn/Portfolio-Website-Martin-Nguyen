# Martin Nguyen - Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, projects, and interests as a Computer Science major and aspiring developer. Here, you’ll find an interactive site that includes an overview of my technical abilities, personal projects, and hobbies.

## Features
- **Interactive Hero Section**: Includes typing animation for my name, a dynamic tagline, and a parallax effect on my profile image.
- **Projects Showcase**: A dynamic display of my projects with hover effects that reveal more information.
- **Contact Form**: A functional contact form integrated with **Formspree** to allow visitors to send me messages directly.
- **Social Links**: Direct links to my **LinkedIn** and **GitHub** profiles for easy connection.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structuring the website content.
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations (including parallax and typing effect).
- **JavaScript**: Adding interactivity, including the typing animation, background movement, and form submission.
- **Formspree**: Handling contact form submissions.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Internet Connection (if using Netlifly link)
- A web browser to view the website.
- No specific setup required since it’s a static website.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
bash
git clone https://github.com/martin-neyugn/Portfolio-Website-Martin-Nguyen.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd portfolio-website
Open index.html in your web browser to view the website.
How It Works
Hero Section: The typing animation and profile image movement are achieved using JavaScript. The parallax effect is handled by detecting the mouse movement and applying a transform to the image.
Projects Page: Projects are displayed in a grid with hover effects that reveal additional project details. They are dynamically added with HTML and styled with CSS.
Contact Form: The form submits to Formspree where you can get notifications when someone contacts you through the website.

### Explanation of Updates:
1. **Added "View the Live Website" Section**:
   - This section includes the **link** to your deployed website on **Netlify**.
   - It explains that users can directly visit the live website without needing to clone or set up the repository.
   
2. **Updated Link**: The link to your deployed website is provided as a call-to-action, making it clear for users to view the live version.

### Final Notes:
- This version of the `README.md` ensures that users who don't want to clone the repository can still easily visit your website using the provided Netlify URL.
- It still retains all the original information about your project, technology stack, and setup instructions for those who want to work locally.
